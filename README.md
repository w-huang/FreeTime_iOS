# FreeTime_iOS
Personal Project Summer 2015, continuing into the 2015 F semester.

FreeTime is a time management app that sorts a user's to-do list by importance and urgency. This way of organizing tasks has been shown to increases effectiveness and overall efficiency in long-term goal progression. The "important" goals we all have, such as eating healthy, getting fit, etc. are less likely to be drowned out by immediate problems such as matters at work, overdue internet bills, etc. 

This is based on the Eisenhower Decision Matrix.
